‘Wall-E’ script has a sound message
</h1>

<p>
When Pixar first started working on “Wall-E” several years ago, the studio considered making the animated movie -- about a lovable robot on a future Earth -- without any dialogue at all. As the film’s screenplay evolved, a few talking humans dropped in, but “Wall-E” is still distinguished by what isn’t said, particularly in the movie’s opening act. </p>

<p>
Although the film’s countless actions speak much louder than its few words, “Wall-E” is based on a fully formed script, nominated for the original screenplay Oscar.</p>

<p>
“That was huge,” the film’s director, Andrew Stanton, who shares his screenwriting nomination with Jim Reardon and Pete Docter, says of the Academy Award recognition. “Because there’s still this lingering, knee-jerk response that animation is a subgenre or that it’s easier than live action.”</p>

<p>
It is nevertheless Pixar’s fifth time in the original screenplay category, with earlier nominations for “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo,” “The Incredibles” and “Ratatouille.” </p>
